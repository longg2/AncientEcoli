Recent whole genome sequencing based on short-read technologies help trace outbreaks and have provided significant insights into the evolution of this pathogen, but these methods don’t capture the genomic variation that underpins differences in zoonotic and pathogenic potential. This variation is, in part, driven by the acquisition of bacteriophages (phages) which contain many similar sequences that require longer read sequencing technologies in order to define their complete composition and position in the genome. This study has used single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing, a long read technique, to define the integrated phage sequences in a strain set selected to represent the wide diversity of EHEC O157.

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.","collected_by:Children's National Hospital",99.9,98.9,,,,"Good","2018-11-30T03:14:23.051Z","2018-11-30T03:14:23.051Z"

Escherichia coli ST131 is a major contributor to hospital and community acquired UTI and is strongly associated with limited treatment options and high rates of recurrence. Here, using a combination of both short and long read sequencing technologies we examined the dynamics of an E. coli ST131 population isolated over a 5-year period (2012-2016) from the urine and feces of a single individual. This longitudinal study provides the first comprehensive, in vivo, genomic analysis of a clonal lineage within a single individual and serves as a valuable resource for understanding how plasmid dynamics contribute to pathogen evolution in a chronic long-term infection.",,99.9,98.8,,,,"Good","2019-07-14T14:23:18.347Z","2019-07-14T14:23:18.347Z"

This study used whole genome sequencing to characterize the evolutionary history of the lineage as it has emerged and spread worldwide, and to explain the genetic context of the CTX-M genes. In order to do this, several DH10B E. coli isolates were transformed with extracted CTX-M plasmids, then sequenced, enabling an approximate reconstruction of the plasmid sequences by bioinformatically removing DH10B-associated reads and undertaking de novo assembly of the residual data.","collected_by:MMM",99.9,98.2,100,,,"Good","2016-01-31T09:05:39.835Z","2016-01-31T09:05:39.835Z"

The strain C1-057 was characterized by a multiplex PCR assay to detect the following genes, rfbE (encoding O157 antigen) fliCh7 (encoding H7 antigen), eae (encoding intimin), stx1 (encoding Shiga toxin 1) and stx2 (encoding Shiga toxin 2). The PCR results confirmed that the strain C1-057 carried the rfbE, fliCh7, eae, but neither stx1 nor stx2. Whole genome sequencing was performed by Pacbio RSII.
